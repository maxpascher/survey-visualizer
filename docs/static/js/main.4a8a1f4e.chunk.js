To address this question, we conduct a study (N = 29) in a mock collaborative manufacturing scenario in which motion-based and display-based intent communication approaches are evaluated under varying penalties for failing to coordinate safely.

Although multimodal intent communication did not significantly improve upon unimodal approaches, merging both motion-based and display-based intent communication seems to combine the strengths of both approaches.

We find that the failure to convey the intention of handing over causes delays in the transfer, while the lack of an intuitive signal to indicate timing of the hand-over causes early, unsuccessful attempts to take the object. We propose to address these problems with the use of spatial contrast, in the form of distinct hand-over poses, and temporal contrast, in the form of unambiguous transitions to the hand-over pose. We conduct a survey to identify distinct hand-over poses, and determine variables of the pose that have most communicative potential for the intent of handing over.

A key factor in this respect is bi-directional communication of navigation intent, which we focus on in this article with a particular view on industrial logistic applications. In the direction robot-to-human, we study how a robot can communicate its navigation intent using Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) such that humans can intuitively understand the robot\u2019s intention and feel safe in the vicinity of robots. We conducted experiments with an autonomous forklift that projects various patterns on the shared floor space to convey its navigation intentions. We analyzed trajectories and eye gaze patterns of humans while interacting with an autonomous forklift and carried out stimulated recall interviews (SRI) in order to identify desirable features for projection of robot intentions. In the direction human-to-robot, we argue that robots in human co-habited environments need human-aware task and motion planning to support safety and efficiency, ideally responding to people\u2019s motion intentions as soon as they can be inferred from human cues. Eye gaze can convey information about intentions beyond what can be inferred from the trajectory and head pose of a person. Hence, we propose eye-tracking glasses as safety equipment in industrial environments shared by humans and robots. In this work, we investigate the possibility of human-to-robot implicit intention transference solely from eye gaze data and evaluate how the observed eye gaze patterns of the participants relate to their navigation decisions. We again analyzed trajectories and eye gaze patterns of humans while interacting with an autonomous forklift for clues that could reveal direction intent.

We applied the concept to a single human/single robot orthogonal encounter scenario, where one of the two parties has to yield the right of way to avoid collision.

To progress on the definition of a database of nonverbal expressions for robot swarms, we first define categories of communicative intents based on spontaneous descriptions of common swarm behaviours. The obtained typology confirms that the first two levels (as defined by Endsley: elements of environment and comprehension of the situation) can be shared through swarms motion-based communication.

Our robot shows its intention to make turn by rotating its head, as though a pedestrian shows a traveling direction by his/her gaze or face direction. The robot is teleoperated by an operator for safety in public spaces, and the direction of the robot head and the moving direction of the robot body are determined by an artificial potential field (APF) generated by a target position given by the operator, positions of obstacles and pedestrians. The APF for a pedestrian is generated based on her/his personal space of a person.

Consider a human teleoperating an assistive robot arm: as the human guides and corrects the arm's motion, the robot gathers information about the human's desired task. But how does the human know what their robot has inferred? Today's approaches often focus on conveying intent: for instance, using legible motions or gestures to indicate what the robot is planning. However, closing the loop on robot inference requires more than just revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should also display the alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human teacher when additional guidance is necessary. In this letter we propose a multimodal approach for communicating robot inference that combines both passive and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich augmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred, and attention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct the human's teaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where the robot must infer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context, we integrate passive and active modalities into a single algorithmic framework that determines when and which type of feedback to provide. Combining both passive and active feedback experimentally outperforms single modality baselines; during an in-person user study, we demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how efficiently humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount of time humans spend interacting with the robot.

We conducted experiments with an autonomous forklift that projects various patterns on the shared floor space to convey its navigation intentions. We analyzed trajectories and eye gaze patterns of humans while interacting with an autonomous forklift and carried out stimulated recall interviews (SRI) in order to identify desirable features for projection of robot intentions. In the direction human-to-robot, we argue that robots in human co-habited environments need human-aware task and motion planning to support safety and efficiency, ideally responding to people\u2019s motion intentions as soon as they can be inferred from human cues. Eye gaze can convey information about intentions beyond what can be inferred from the trajectory and head pose of a person. Hence, we propose eye-tracking glasses as safety equipment in industrial environments shared by humans and robots. In this work, we investigate the possibility of human-to-robot implicit intention transference solely from eye gaze data and evaluate how the observed eye gaze patterns of the participants relate to their navigation decisions.

Especially this paper describes people's understandability of robot behaviors when a robot turns around a corner or when a person and a robot pass each other in a corridor. Our robot shows its intention to make turn by rotating its head, as though a pedestrian shows a traveling direction by his/her gaze or face direction. The robot is teleoperated by an operator for safety in public spaces, and the direction of the robot head and the moving direction of the robot body are determined by an artificial potential field (APF) generated by a target position given by the operator, positions of obstacles and pedestrians. The APF for a pedestrian is generated based on her/his personal space of a person. Thus, the robot can express the intention of its action by rotating the head to look where it is going, when the robot changes its direction around pedestrians. The intention expression can be natural and understandable for them by the rotational movement of the head before the robot turns its body actually. Impression evaluation experiments with questionnaires were conducted under the two kinds of situations to reveal the validity and effectiveness of the intention expression by the robot's head rotation.

Consider a human teleoperating an assistive robot arm: as the human guides and corrects the arm's motion, the robot gathers information about the human's desired task. But how does the human know what their robot has inferred? Today's approaches often focus on conveying intent: for instance, using legible motions or gestures to indicate what the robot is planning. However, closing the loop on robot inference requires more than just revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should also display the alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human teacher when additional guidance is necessary. In this letter we propose a multimodal approach for communicating robot inference that combines both passive and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich augmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred, and attention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct the human's teaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where the robot must infer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context, we integrate passive and active modalities into a single algorithmic framework that determines when and which type of feedback to provide. Combining both passive and active feedback experimentally outperforms single modality baselines; during an in-person user study, we demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how efficiently humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount of time humans spend interacting with the robot.

This paper explores the idea of using active human-robot communication to facilitate navigation tasks. We propose to convey a robot's intent to human users via a wearable haptic interface. The interface can display distinct haptic cues by modulating vibration amplitudes and patterns. We applied the concept to a single human/single robot orthogonal encounter scenario, where one of the two parties has to yield the right of way to avoid collision. Under certain conditions, the robot's intent (to yield to the human or not) is revealed to the human via the haptic interface prior to the interaction. We conducted an experiment with 10 users, in which the robot was teleoperated as a substitute for autonomy. Results show that, when given priority, users become more risk-accepting and use different strategies to navigate the collision scenario than when the robot takes priority or there is no haptic communication channel.

Our robot shows its intention to make turn by rotating its head, as though a pedestrian shows a traveling direction by his/her gaze or face direction.

Consider a human teleoperating an assistive robot arm: as the human guides and corrects the arm's motion, the robot gathers information about the human's desired task. But how does the human know what their robot has inferred? Today's approaches often focus on conveying intent: for instance, using legible motions or gestures to indicate what the robot is planning. However, closing the loop on robot inference requires more than just revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should also display the alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human teacher when additional guidance is necessary. In this letter we propose a multimodal approach for communicating robot inference that combines both passive and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich augmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred, and attention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct the human's teaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where the robot must infer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context, we integrate passive and active modalities into a single algorithmic framework that determines when and which type of feedback to provide. Combining both passive and active feedback experimentally outperforms single modality baselines; during an in-person user study, we demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how efficiently humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount of time humans spend interacting with the robot.

Our analyses of the relationship between robot gaze direction and the likelihood that someone takes a drink show that if people do not already have a drink and the interaction is not dominated by an overly enthusiastic user, the robot\u2019s gaze behavior is effective in selecting an interaction partner even "in the wild".',authors:"Palinko, Oskar; Fischer, Kerstin; Ruiz Ramirez, Eduardo; Damsgaard Nissen, Lotte; Langedijk, Rosalyn M.",venue:"ACM",year:2020,link:"https://doi.org/10.1145/3371382.3378339",tags:[{name:"Intent Location",parent:null},{name:"On-Robot",parent:"Intent Location"},{name:"Robot-Attached",parent:"On-Robot"}]},{UID:63,citations:[],selected:!0,slug:"paper_63",title:"Fostering short-term human anticipatory behavior in human-robot collaboration",abstract:"The present study reports on a human-robot collaboration experiment involving an industrial task with the specific aim of exploring the effects of (i) fostering human anticipatory behavior towards the robot, through visual cues of the robot\u2019s next move and (ii) robot adaptiveness to the human actions through reducing its motion speed with respect to human movement\u2019s proximity.

To address this question, we conduct a study (N = 29) in a mock collaborative manufacturing scenario in which motion-based and display-based intent communication approaches are evaluated under varying penalties for failing to coordinate safely. Subjective and objective measures of team fluency suggest that although intent communication supports fluent coordination, using a purely motion-based or a purely display-based approach may not be the most effective strategy. Although multimodal intent communication did not significantly improve upon unimodal approaches, merging both motion-based and display-based intent communication seems to combine the strengths of both approaches.

We find that the failure to convey the intention of handing over causes delays in the transfer, while the lack of an intuitive signal to indicate timing of the hand-over causes early, unsuccessful attempts to take the object. We propose to address these problems with the use of spatial contrast, in the form of distinct hand-over poses, and temporal contrast, in the form of unambiguous transitions to the hand-over pose. We conduct a survey to identify distinct hand-over poses, and determine variables of the pose that have most communicative potential for the intent of handing over.

A key factor in this respect is bi-directional communication of navigation intent, which we focus on in this article with a particular view on industrial logistic applications. In the direction robot-to-human, we study how a robot can communicate its navigation intent using Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) such that humans can intuitively understand the robot\u2019s intention and feel safe in the vicinity of robots. We conducted experiments with an autonomous forklift that projects various patterns on the shared floor space to convey its navigation intentions. We analyzed trajectories and eye gaze patterns of humans while interacting with an autonomous forklift and carried out stimulated recall interviews (SRI) in order to identify desirable features for projection of robot intentions. In the direction human-to-robot, we argue that robots in human co-habited environments need human-aware task and motion planning to support safety and efficiency, ideally responding to people\u2019s motion intentions as soon as they can be inferred from human cues. Eye gaze can convey information about intentions beyond what can be inferred from the trajectory and head pose of a person. Hence, we propose eye-tracking glasses as safety equipment in industrial environments shared by humans and robots. In this work, we investigate the possibility of human-to-robot implicit intention transference solely from eye gaze data and evaluate how the observed eye gaze patterns of the participants relate to their navigation decisions. We again analyzed trajectories and eye gaze patterns of humans while interacting with an autonomous forklift for clues that could reveal direction intent.

Specifically, we will start with a discussion on how projection actions can be used to reveal information regarding the future intentions of the robot at the time of task execution. We will then pose a new planning paradigm - projection-aware planning - whereby a robot can trade off its plan cost with its ability to reveal its intentions using its projection actions.

We applied the concept to a single human/single robot orthogonal encounter scenario, where one of the two parties has to yield the right of way to avoid collision.

Consider a human teleoperating an assistive robot arm: as the human guides and corrects the arm's motion, the robot gathers information about the human's desired task. But how does the human know what their robot has inferred? Today's approaches often focus on conveying intent: for instance, using legible motions or gestures to indicate what the robot is planning. However, closing the loop on robot inference requires more than just revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should also display the alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human teacher when additional guidance is necessary. In this letter we propose a multimodal approach for communicating robot inference that combines both passive and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich augmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred, and attention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct the human's teaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where the robot must infer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context, we integrate passive and active modalities into a single algorithmic framework that determines when and which type of feedback to provide. Combining both passive and active feedback experimentally outperforms single modality baselines; during an in-person user study, we demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how efficiently humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount of time humans spend interacting with the robot.
